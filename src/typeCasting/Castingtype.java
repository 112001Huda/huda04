/*
 java doesn't allow Downcasting Bec In downcasting we create referance of child class but create object of parent class
 some methods are written in only in child class which are not present in parent class  so at compile time we found the
 method at child class but at runtime we can't find the method at parent class it don't show o/p it make confusing  .
